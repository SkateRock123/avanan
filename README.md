Hello and Thank you for the opportunity to interview with all of you. 

I believe my Python skills may not be up to par with your qualifications. I tried. I looked into nodes, linked lists. and I couln't figure out with my current knowledge how to traverse those data structures. I just started really learning python a few weeks ago and am proud of my progress. This code is a psuedo version of a filesystem. Because I felt like taking code off of stack overflow and amending it was cheating, and using modules was cheating. I only got this far. I hope you enjoy the not finished filesystem.  

I really enjoyed all of the interview process. And, if I was not still in school I believe I would have had more time to learn about oop and complete this assignment.

Thank you,

Jordan
